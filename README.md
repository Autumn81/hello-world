# hello-world

Hello GitHubbers and Co,

My name in Autumn and I'm completely new to this world.
Well, other than occassional backend gopher work.
A relational psychotherapist and confident researcher, and kinda green to programming.
Since I am extending work into computational autism and machine learning, seemed like a good time to start learning data science and programming!

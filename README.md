# hello-world

Hello GitHubbers and Co,

My name in Autumn and I'm completely new to this world.
Well, other than occassional backend gopher work.
I'm a relational psychotherapist and qual researcher, so kinda green to programming.
Since I am extending research into computational psychology, seemed like a good time to start learning more about Git!
